## issue
 * When you click(ie: touch) long, the select and copy menu bar will display.I don't want this effect cause I want my app like native apps other than webview pages. 

## solution(android)
at the main activity, you can add some code to prevent the long click event.
      
```java    
    //public void onCreate(){ ... }    
    
        super.appView.setOnLongClickListener(new View.OnLongClickListener() {
            public boolean onLongClick(View v) {    
                return true;
            }
        });
```  
## other solutions  
- this maybe can work well at ios (didn't test!)  
```html
    
        html {  
            -webkit-user-select: none;
        }
```
